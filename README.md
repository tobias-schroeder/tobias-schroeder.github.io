I am a PhD student in Mathematics at Imperial College London supervised by [Andrew Duncan](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~aduncan/) and [Greg Pavliotis](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~pavl/).

## Summary
My research focuses on developing and analysing robust methodologies for unsupervised machine learning based on techniques from physics, mathematical analysis, and optimisation. Currently, I am working on an improved training methodology for energy-based models for generative modelling and inference.

## Projects
#### How to train your EBM without sampling or gradients
We are currently developing a new training methodology for energy-based models which does not rely on samples (like contrastive divergence) or higher order derivatives (as in score-based methods).

#### Variational Inference as a gradient flow in a kernelised Wasserstein geometry
Variational Inference optimises a training objective with gradient descent to infer optimal parameters in a parametric family of distributions, for example, to compute an approximate Bayesian posterior distribution. For my Master thesis, I formulated the training dynamics as a gradient flow in a kernelised Wasserstein geometry based on the results on [Stein geometries](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00894) and a [relationship between gradient flows and black box variational inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01822)
