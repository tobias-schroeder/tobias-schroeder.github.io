## Tobias Schröder

My name is Tobias Schröder. I am a PhD student in Mathematics at Imperial College London supervised by [Andrew Duncan](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~aduncan/) and [Greg Pavliotis](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~pavl/).

### Research
I am currently working on particle based methods for generative modelling. My research interests also include theory and applications of Stein's method, kernel Hilbert spaces, and optimal transport.
